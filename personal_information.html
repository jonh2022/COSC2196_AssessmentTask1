    <h1>Name, student number, student email address, picture, basic background information</h1>
      <p>My name is Jo Haythornthwaite, and I am very much looking forward to this course.  As can be seen from the photo, I am a mature aged student.  With my very limited IT background I expect to find this course very challenging.</p>
      <p>My student number is s3343061 and my student email address is s3343061@student.rmit. edu.au</p>
      <p>I live in Quairading, a small wheatbelt town in Western Australia with a population of just over 1000 people.  Quairading is located about 200 kilometres east of Perth and is where my family and I were, until recently, involved in a farming operation.</p>
      <p>My first experience of post school education was back in the early 80’s when I graduated in 1983 as a high school music teacher.  I did not spend a great deal of time in classroom teaching, as shortly after graduating I moved towards teaching the piano privately – a career which I have thoroughly enjoyed.  </p>
      <p>In recent years I have attempted to study in a number of areas, and it would be fair to say that, although I have achieved at a high level in some individual units, I haven’t really completed any course due to jumping from course to course and stopping and starting.   There are 3 main reasons why I believe that I have been unsuccessful in completing courses.</p>
      <p>The first is that for the last 2 – 2 ½ years I have been the primary carer for my husband (who is much older than I).  This has meant that have often been difficulties in having the time available that is required to dedicate to my learning.  Unfortunately, he has now needed to enter an aged care facility and, although this is difficult, it has left me with the time to pursue interests that I simply have not had over the past few years.  </p>
      <p>Secondly, I tend to extreme perfectionism.  Unfortunately, this constantly has me doubting my abilities and, on a number of occasions I have withdrawn from courses not for fear of failure, but due to the fear that I may not receive a High Distinction.  Enrolling in this unit will, I hope, assist in managing this tendency, as I am hoping that starting from such I low IT base I will focus on what I learn, not on what mark I receive.  </p>
      <p>The final reason that I have failed to stay with one area of study is that there are simply so many interesting things to learn in life.  Because of this I constantly change my mind about which direction is the right direction for me.  Despite this I still have the goal of completing an undergraduate degree in my lifetime (unfortunately my teaching qualification back in the 1980’s was an Advanced Diploma, not a degree) and maybe it will be in the IT field!</p>

    <h2>Fact(s) that others may find interesting, such as a hobby, pet, favourite sport or pastime</h2>
      <p>With regards to other facts about myself, there are two things that I would like to share.</p>
      <p>Firstly, I am a Shire Councillor on our Local Government.  I have been in this role for 6 ½ years and thoroughly enjoy the opportunity that this role gives in allowing me to give back to our community.  Also, crocheting is a hobby that I really enjoy.  I began this just over 12 months ago when I needed an activity to keep me busy during the many hours of sitting and waiting at medical appointments for my husband.  The enjoyment has continued and now my many hours of crocheting give me the opportunity to justify binge watching Netflix, which is, of course, an opportunity too good to pass up!!</P>
